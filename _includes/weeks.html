## Footnotes

1. I believe that the 430 years in Egypt are counted starting from Ya'aqov's arrival there. It seems that many chronologies online get this wrong. *"Now the duration of the Israelites' stay in Egypt was 430 years."* {% include inline-verse.html verse="Exodus 12:40" text-before="(" text-after=")." %} I suppose that their slavery started 30 years later once there was a new pharoah, beginning the 400 years of slavery {% include inline-verse.html verse="Genesis 15:13" text-before="(" text-after=")." %} When Paul mentions there being 430 years from "the promise" {% include inline-verse.html verse="Galatians 3:16-17" text-before="(" text-after=")," %} he is either wrong or people are misinterpreting him.
1. I stopped doing detailed dates after the Exodus.
1. The date of 4000 for the crucifixion is a common one I saw online. Comparing it with the Prophecy of Weeks with 700-year weeks, it seems like this date is in the right ballpark, albeit possibly slightly early.
