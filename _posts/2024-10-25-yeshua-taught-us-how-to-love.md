Much of Yeshua's ministry was focused on these two commandments:

{% include verse.html
text="“Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?” Jesus said to him, “**‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’** This is the first and great commandment. A second likewise is this, **‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’** The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments.”"
verse="Matthew 22:36-40"
%}

Take, for example, Yeshua's commandments to forgive and not to hate others. Are these really new commandments, or are they teaching us how to keep the above commandments from Torah? (See [The Law Remains](/the-law-remains).)

## Loving our Neighbor

### Love Kindness

{% include verse.html
text="He has told you, O man, what is good; And what does YHWH require of you But to do justice, to **love kindness**, And to walk humbly with your God?"
verse="Micah 6:8"
version="NASB1995"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="Thus has YHWH of Armies spoken, saying, ‘Execute true judgment, and **show kindness and compassion every man to his brother**. Don’t oppress the widow, the fatherless, the foreigner, nor the poor; and let none of you devise evil against his brother in your heart.’"
verse="Zechariah 7:9-10"
%}

### You Shall Not Murder

{% include verse.html
text="“You have heard that it was said to the ancient ones, ‘You shall not murder;’ and ‘Whoever murders will be in danger of the judgment.’ **But I tell you that everyone who is angry with his brother without a cause will be in danger of the judgment. Whoever says to his brother, ‘Raca!’ will be in danger of the council. Whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be in danger of the fire of Gehenna.** If therefore you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has anything against you, leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift."
verse="Matthew 5:21-24"
%}

These are all examples of unloving attitudes. Anger with a brother or sister violates the sixth commandment (not to murder). Moreover, it violates the commandment to love our neighbor.

We also see that love seeks reconciliation, so that our brethren do not harbor angry, unforgiving thoughts in their hearts and thus stray from the Way.

{% include verse.html
text="**Whoever hates his brother is a murderer**, and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him."
verse="1 John 3:15"
%}

### Forgive

<div class="columns">
{% include verse.html
text="Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone; so that your Father, who is in heaven, may also forgive you your transgressions."
verse="Mark 11:25"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you don’t forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses."
verse="Matthew 6:14-15"
%}
</div>

{% include verse.html
text="Then Peter came and said to him, “Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?” Jesus said to him, “I don’t tell you until seven times, but, until seventy times seven."
verse="Matthew 18:21-22"
%}

Forgiveness is an act of love and mercy.

{% include verse.html
text="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint, dill, and cumin, and have left undone the weightier matters of the law: **justice, mercy, and faith**. But you ought to have done these, and not to have left the other undone."
verse="Matthew 23:23"
%}

### Do Not Judge

{% include verse.html
text="Don’t judge, so that you won’t be judged. For with whatever judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you."
verse="Matthew 7:1-2"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="For judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment."
verse="James 2:13"
%}

When we judge too quickly, we become someone's accuser. I wonder, isn't it better to give someone the benefit of the doubt, for as long as possible?

{% include verse.html
text="If your brother sins against you, go, show him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained back your brother. But if he doesn’t listen, take one or two more with you, that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the assembly. If he refuses to hear the assembly also, let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector."
verse="Matthew 18:15-17"
%}

This sounds to me like the proper and loving way to deal with our brethren trapped in sin.

### Love Your Enemies

{% include verse.html
text="But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you, that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Don’t even the tax collectors do the same?"
verse="Matthew 5:44-46"

### Do Not Slander

<div class="columns">

### Charity and Service

text="Then the King will tell those on his right hand, ‘Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; **for I was hungry and you gave me food to eat. I was thirsty and you gave me drink. I was a stranger and you took me in. I was naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you came to me.**’"

## Loving God

### Believe

{% include verse.html
text="Don’t let your heart be troubled. Believe in God. Believe also in me."
verse="John 14:1"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="Trust in YHWH with all your heart, and don’t lean on your own understanding."
verse="Proverbs 3:5"
%}

### Obedience

{% include verse.html
text="You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition. You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying, ‘These people draw near to me with their mouth, and honor me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. And they worship me in vain, teaching as doctrine rules made by men.’"
verse="Matthew 15:6-9"
%}

We must obey God not on human terms, but on His terms, which He clearly laid out for us. (See [The Law Remains](/the-law-remains).)

{% include verse.html
text="Don’t think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets. I didn’t come to destroy, but to fulfill. For most certainly, I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even one smallest letter or one tiny pen stroke shall in any way pass away from the law, until all things are accomplished. Therefore, whoever shall break one of these least commandments and teach others to do so, shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven; but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven. For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, there is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven."
verse="Matthew 5:17-20"
%}

Trusting obedience is how we love God (not deeming some commandments as "lesser" to justify ignoring them).

{% include verse.html
text="**If you love me, keep my commandments.**"
verse="John 14:15"
%}

Yeshua was not teaching something new:

{% include verse.html
text="... showing loving kindness to thousands of those who **love me and keep my commandments**."
verse="Deuteronomy 5:10"
%}

### Be His Witness

{% include verse.html
text="Everyone therefore who confesses me before men, I will also confess him before my Father who is in heaven. But whoever denies me before men, I will also deny him before my Father who is in heaven."
verse="Matthew 10:32-33"
%}

This is a sobering warning to those who are ashamed of God and His Son. If we really loved Them, would we not confess Them?

### Seek The Kingdom First

{% include verse.html
text="No one can serve two masters, for either he will **hate the one and love the other**, or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You can’t serve both God and Mammon."
verse="Matthew 6:24"
%}

To love God, you must be devoted to Him "with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind".

{% include verse.html
text="Therefore don’t be anxious, saying, ‘What will we eat?’, ‘What will we drink?’ or, ‘With what will we be clothed?’ For the Gentiles seek after all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. **But seek first God’s Kingdom and his righteousness; and all these things will be given to you as well.** Therefore don’t be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Each day’s own evil is sufficient."
verse="Matthew 6:31-34"
%}

Trust Him, and seek His Kingdom above all else. That is how we love Him.

### Love Others

{% include verse.html
text="Then the King will tell those on his right hand, ‘Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry and you gave me food to eat. I was thirsty and you gave me drink. I was a stranger and you took me in. I was naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you came to me.’ “Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you a drink? When did we see you as a stranger and take you in, or naked and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and come to you?’ “The King will answer them, **‘Most certainly I tell you, because you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.’**"
verse="Matthew 25:34-40"
%}

At the end of the day, by loving our neighbor (through actions) we also love our Creator.

{% include verse.html
text="God created man in his own image. In God’s image he created him; male and female he created them."
verse="Genesis 1:27"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="If a man says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar; **for he who doesn’t love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?**"
verse="1 John 4:20"
%}
