**Note:** This study will be more speculative than my others so far. I want to share an interesting discovery, while reminding the reader, as always, to test everything and that our only teacher is Messiah.

Background context: [Revealed: The Land of Jesus - Strait is the Gate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFu0HqJ3lts). The premise of this video is that the [camp of the saints](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rev%2020%3A9&version=NRSVUE) is located in the "Terre de Iesso" (Land of Jesus) that is found on old maps.

My finding is that this location for the camp of the saints (and Mount Zion) is consistent with the geography in The Book of Enoch.

## Mount Zion?

{% include verse.html
text="I saw at the end of the earth the firmament of the heaven above. And I proceeded and saw a place which burns day and night, where there are seven mountains of magnificent stones, three towards the east, and three towards the south. And as for those towards the east, was of coloured stone, and one of pearl, and one of jacinth, and those towards the south of red stone. **But the middle one reached to heaven like the throne of God**, of alabaster, and the summit of the throne was of sapphire. And I saw a flaming fire. And beyond these mountains Is a region the end of the great earth: there the heavens were completed."
verse="Enoch 18:6-9"

%}

Is the middle mountain, Mount Zion in the north?

{% include verse.html
text="beautiful in elevation, is the joy of all the earth, Mount Zion, in the far north, the city of the great King."
verse="Psalm 48:2"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="But you said in your heart, â€˜I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God, And I will sit on the mount of assembly In the [sides] of the north."
verse="Isaiah 14:13"
version="NASB"
%}

Back to Enoch:

{% include verse.html
text="And from thence I went to another place of the earth, and he showed me a mountain range of fire which burnt day and night. And I went beyond it and saw seven magnificent mountains all differing each from the other, and the stones (thereof) were magnificent and beautiful, magnificent as a whole, of glorious appearance and fair exterior: three towards the east, one founded on the other, and three towards the south, one upon the other, and deep rough ravines, no one of which joined with any other. **And the seventh mountain was in the midst of these, and it excelled them in height, resembling the seat of a throne:** and fragrant trees encircled the throne."
verse="Enoch 24:1-4"
url="https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#24"
%}

This verse seems to describe the same seven mountains.

{% include verse.html
text="**'This high mountain which thou hast seen, whose summit is like the throne of God, is His throne,** where the Holy Great One, the Lord of Glory, the Eternal King, will sit, when He shall come down to visit the earth with goodness."
verse="Enoch 25:3-4"
url="https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#24"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="And the fourth quarter, named the north, is divided into three parts: the first of them is for the dwelling of men: and the second contains seas of water, and the abysses and forests and rivers, and darkness and clouds; and the third part contains the garden of righteousness. I saw seven high mountains, higher than all the mountains which are on the earth"
verse="Enoch 77:3-4"
url="https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#77"
%}

The seven mountains appear to be in the north, along with the gardens of righteousness.

{% include verse.html
text="**And they brought me to the place of darkness, and to a mountain the point of whose summit reached to heaven.** [...] I saw the great rivers and came to the great river and to the great darkness, and went to the place where no flesh walks. I saw the mountains of the <strong>darkness of winter</strong> and the place whence all the waters of the deep flow."
verse="Enoch 17:2,6-8"
url="https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#17"
%}

Mount Zion is in a place of great darkness, where no flesh walks, in the
darkness of winter. This all sounds consistent with it being located in the
extreme north.

## The Camp of the Saints

{% include verse.html
text="And from that day I was no longer numbered amongst them: and he set me between the two winds, between the North and the West, where the angels took the cords to measure for me **the place for the elect and righteous.** And there I saw the first fathers and the righteous who from the beginning dwell in that place."
verse="Enoch 70:3-4"
url="https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#70"
%}

Is "the place for the elect and righteous" the same as the camp of the saints in {% include inline-verse.html verse="Revelation 20:9" text-after="?" %} Of note is that this location is in the north-west here in Enoch.

{% include verse.html
text="They marched up over the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city. And fire came down from heaven and consumed them."
verse="Revelation 20:9"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="And I saw in those days how long cords were given to those angels, and they took to themselves wings and flew, and they went towards the **north.** [...] And the angel who went with me said unto me: ' These shall bring the measures of the righteous, And the ropes of the righteous to the righteous, That they may stay themselves on the name of the Lord of Spirits for ever and ever. The elect shall begin to dwell with the elect, And those are the measures which shall be given to faith And which shall strengthen righteousness."
verse="Enoch 61:1,3-4"
url="https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#61"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="And in those days a whirlwind carried me off from the earth, And set me down at **the end of the heavens.** And there I saw another vision, the dwelling-places of the holy, And the resting-places of the righteous. Here mine eyes saw their dwellings with His righteous angels, And their resting-places with the holy."
verse="Enoch 39:3-5"
url="https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#39"
%}

## The Two Seas

{% include verse.html
text="And after these fragrant odours, as I looked towards the north over the mountains I saw seven mountains full of choice nard and fragrant trees and cinnamon and pepper. And thence I went over the summits of all these mountains, **far towards the east of the earth, and passed above the Erythraean sea and went far from it,** and passed over the angel Zotiel. And I came to the Garden of Righteousness,"
verse="Enoch 32:1-2"
url="https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#32"
%}

It looks like the Erythraean Sea is to the east of the seven mountains.

{% include verse.html
text="I saw seven rivers on the earth larger than all the rivers: one of them coming from the west pours its waters into the Great Sea. And these two come from the north to the sea and pour their waters into the Erythraean Sea in the east. And the remaining, four come forth on the side of the north to their own sea, two of them to the Erythraean Sea, and two into the Great Sea and discharge themselves there"
verse="Enoch 77:5-7"
url="https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#77"
%}

It seems that there are two main oceans in the world: the Great Sea and the
Erythrean Sea. Could these be the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, respectively? The
Great Sea is west of Jerusalem:

{% include verse.html
text="For the western boundary, you shall have the Great Sea and its coast; this shall be your western boundary."
verse="Numbers 34:6"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="The western border was at the Great Sea, even its coastline. This is the border around the sons of Judah according to their families."
verse="Joshua 15:12"
version="NASB"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="On that day living water shall flow out from Jerusalem, **half of it to the eastern sea and half of it to the western sea;** it shall continue in summer as in winter."
verse="Zechariah 14:8"
%}

In the following verses about the two seas the "ends of the earth" are also mentioned, as we saw above in {% include inline-verse.html verse="Enoch 18:6-9" url="https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#18" text-after=":" %}

{% capture inline %}
Note that while this verse is about Solomon, it is also a prophecy as it is repeated in the Zechariah verse below!
{% endcapture %}
{% include verse.html
text="May he have dominion from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth."
verse="Psalm 72:8"
caption=inline
%}

{% include verse.html
text="and he shall command peace to the nations; his dominion shall be from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth."
verse="Zechariah 9:10"
%}

## A Possible Map?

Here is my latest understanding of the true geography, based on the scriptural evidence:
