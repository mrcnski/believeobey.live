## Mercy

{% include verse.html
text="**He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness. You were healed by his wounds.**"
verse="1 Peter 2:24"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="**Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring you to God** ..."
verse="1 Peter 3:18"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="Surely he has borne our sickness and carried our suffering; yet we considered him plagued, struck by God, and afflicted. **But he was pierced for our transgressions. He was crushed for our iniquities. The punishment that brought our peace was on him; and by his wounds we are healed.** All we like sheep have gone astray. Everyone has turned to his own way; and **YHWH has laid on him the iniquity of us all**. [...] He was taken away by oppression and judgment. As for his generation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living and **stricken for the disobedience of my people**? [...] Yet it pleased YHWH to bruise him. He has caused him to suffer. When you make his soul **an offering for sin**, he will see his offspring. He will prolong his days and YHWH’s pleasure will prosper in his hand. After the suffering of his soul, he will see the light and be satisfied. **My righteous servant will justify many by the knowledge of himself; and he will bear their iniquities.** Therefore I will give him a portion with the great. He will divide the plunder with the strong, because he poured out his soul to death and was counted with the transgressors; yet **he bore the sins of many and made intercession for the transgressors**."
verse="Isaiah 53:4-6,8,10-12"

text="I will pour on David’s house and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the **spirit of grace** and of supplication. They will look to me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him as one mourns for his only son, and will grieve bitterly for him as one grieves for his firstborn."

text="If there is beside him an angel, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show to man what is right for him, then **God is gracious to him, and says, ‘Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom.’** His flesh will be fresher than a child’s. He returns to the days of his youth. He prays to God, and he is favorable to him, so that he sees his face with joy. **He restores to man his righteousness.** He sings before men, and says, ‘I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it didn’t profit me. He has redeemed my soul from going into the pit. My life will see the light.’"
verse="Job 33:23-28"

The word "ransom" in Hebrew is {% include concordance-hebrew.html number="3724" text="*kopher*" %}, which can mean a covering. It's closely related to the Hebrew word {% include concordance-hebrew.html number="3722" text="*kaphar*" %} which means "to cover".

## The Lamb

Note that the <a href="https://www.hebrewgospels.com/_files/ugd/c68db9_a93ec196f4b144948b2632acae6fefab.pdf">Hebrew John</a> reads "God" instead of "the lamb of God".

text="Abraham said, “**God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering**, my son.”"
verse="Genesis 22:8"

A few verses later, it is a ram that is sacrificed, and not a lamb. Notice the name of the mountain, indicating that the fulfillment of the providing is still future:

{% include verse.html
text="Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and saw that behind him was a **ram** caught in the thicket by his horns. Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son. Abraham called the name of that place **“YHWH Will Provide”**. As it is said to this day, **“On YHWH’s mountain, it will be provided.”**"
verse="Genesis 22:13-14"

verse="1 John 4:9-10"

## The Covenant

{% include verse.html
text="As for you also, **because of the blood of your covenant, I have set free your prisoners from the pit in which is no water**. Turn to the stronghold, you prisoners of hope! Even today I declare that I will restore double to you."
verse="Zechariah 9:11-12"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="I, YHWH, have called you in righteousness. I will hold your hand. I will keep you, and make you a **covenant** for the people, as a light for the nations, to open the blind eyes, to bring the prisoners out of the dungeon, and those who sit in darkness out of the prison."
