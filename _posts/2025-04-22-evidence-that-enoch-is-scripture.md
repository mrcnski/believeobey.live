This is not an exhaustive compilation of evidence, but only what I've personally made a note of in my study of the Book of Enoch.

While I believe that most of Enoch is Scripture, I have found what seem to be corruptions and insertions. In particular, the verses where Noah is speaking do not seem to belong to Enoch, and even contradict the rest of the book. I hope to do a separate study on this.

## The Strongest Evidence

{% include verse.html
text="About these also **Enoch**, the seventh from Adam, **prophesied**, saying, **“Behold, the Lord came with ten thousands of his holy ones, to execute judgment on all, and to convict all the ungodly of all their works of ungodliness which they have done in an ungodly way, and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.”**"
verse="Jude 14-15"
%}

Jude quotes not from anywhere in the canon, but from the Book of Enoch:

{% include verse.html
text="And behold! He cometh with ten thousands of His holy ones To execute judgement upon all, And to destroy all the ungodly: And to convict all flesh Of all the works of their ungodliness which they have ungodly committed, And of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him."
verse="Enoch 1:9"
%}

---

Yeshua also apparently referred to Enoch as authoritative, even as Scripture:

{% include verse.html
text="But Jesus answered them, “You are mistaken, not knowing the **Scriptures**, nor the power of God. For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like God’s angels in heaven."
verse="Matthew 22:29-30"
%}

The canonical scriptures do not speak about angels marrying. The only place I know of where this is addressed is Enoch:

{% include verse.html
text="And therefore I have not appointed wives for you; for as for the spiritual ones of the heaven, in heaven is their dwelling."
verse="Enoch 15:7"
%}

By saying that the Sadduccees [Zadokites] did not know the scriptures, it would seem that Messiah was implicitly affirming that Enoch is indeed scripture.

## Direct Quotes in the Canon

Here are some more instances where the canonical books seem to quote almost verbatim from Enoch:

---

text="But for the elect there shall be light and joy and peace, And they shall inherit the earth."

text="The sea gave up the dead who were in it. Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them. They were judged, each one according to his works."

</div>

## References in Scripture

{% include verse.html
text="When men began to multiply on the surface of the ground, and daughters were born to them, God’s sons saw that men’s daughters were beautiful, and they took any that they wanted for themselves as wives. [...] The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when **God’s sons came in to men’s daughters** and had children with them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown."
verse="Genesis 6:1-2,4"
%}

This account in Genesis doesn't elaborate on who the sons of God are, which has led to much speculation about these verses. It seems that the writer of Genesis was assuming familiarity with an existing tradition -- possibly the book written by Enoch before the flood.

{% include verse.html
text="And it came to pass when the children of men had multiplied that in those days were born unto them beautiful and comely daughters. And **the angels, the children of the heaven,** saw and lusted after them, and said to one another: 'Come, let us choose us wives from among the children of men and beget us children.'"
verse="Enoch 6:1-3"
%}

The sons of God being angels is consistent with other Scripture:

{% include verse.html
text="Now on the day when God’s sons came to present themselves before YHWH, Satan also came among them."
verse="Job 1:6"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? [...] What were its foundations fastened on? Or who laid its cornerstone, when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?"
verse="Job 38:4-7"
%}

---

{% include verse.html
text="Angels who didn’t keep their first domain, but deserted their own dwelling place, he has kept in everlasting bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day."
verse="Jude 6"
%}

What Jude is referring to is not found in canon, but in Enoch:

{% include verse.html
text="bind them [fallen Watchers] fast for seventy generations in the valleys of the earth, till the day of their judgement and of their consummation, till the judgement that is for ever and ever is consummated."
verse="Enoch 10:12-13"
%}

---

{% capture scapegoat %}
Note: many translations, instead of keeping the name "Azazel", mistakenly translate it as "scapegoat".
{% endcapture %}
{% include verse.html
text="but the goat on which the lot fell for Azazel shall be presented alive before YHWH to make atonement over it, that it may be sent away into the wilderness to Azazel."
verse="Leviticus 16:10"
version="NRSV"
caption=scapegoat
%}

Who is the Azazel mentioned in Scripture? It is never explained, because readers would have been already familiar with the Book of Enoch (written before Leviticus):

{% include verse.html
text="And the whole earth has been corrupted through the works that were taught by Azazel: to him ascribe all sin."
verse="Enoch 10:8-9"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="And these are the names of the holy angels who watch. <strong>Uriel</strong>, one of the holy angels, who is over the world and over Tartarus. <strong>Raphael</strong>, one of the holy angels, who is over the spirits of men. <strong>Raguel</strong>, one of the holy angels who takes vengeance on the world of the luminaries. <strong>Michael</strong>, one of the holy angels, to wit, he that is set over the best part of mankind and over chaos. <strong>Saraqael</strong>, one of the holy angels, who is set over the spirits, who sin in the spirit. <strong>Gabriel</strong>, one of the holy angels, who is over Paradise and the serpents and the Cherubim. <strong>Remiel</strong>, one of the holy angels, whom God set over those who rise."

## Other Points of Interest

Here I present some other aspects of Enoch that agree with Scripture.

### The Animal Prophecy

Enoch chapters [85](https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#85) to [90](https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#90) contain an epic prophecy about the history of the chosen people. As it's a long prophecy, I will not reproduce it here. But the interesting thing is that there are at least a few sections in the canon that are remarkably similar to Enoch's animal prophecy: {% include inline-verse.html verse="Isaiah 56:9-12" text-after="," %} {% include inline-verse.html verse="Ezekiel 34" text-after="," %} and {% include inline-verse.html verse="Ezekiel 39:17-18" text-after="." %} I also won't reproduce these here, but I recommend studying them and comparing them to Enoch.

<div class="columns">
{% include verse.html
text="... and those <span class='hl-1'>wild beasts</span> began to tear in pieces those <span class='hl-2'>sheep</span>. And I saw that He forsook that their house and their tower and gave them all into the hand of the lions, to tear and <span class='hl-3'>devour</span> them, into the hand of all the <span class='hl-1'>wild beasts</span>."
verse="Enoch 89:55-56"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="Is my heritage to me as a speckled bird of prey? Are the birds of prey against her all around? Go, assemble all the <span class='hl-1'>animals of the field</span>. Bring them to <span class='hl-3'>devour</span>."
verse="Jeremiah 12:9"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="All you <span class='hl-1'>animals of the field</span>, come to <span class='hl-3'>devour</span>, all you animals in the forest."
verse="Isaiah 56:9"

{% include verse.html
text="They were scattered, because there was no shepherd. <span class='hl-3'>They became food</span> to all the <span class='hl-1'>animals of the field</span>, and were scattered. [...] “As I live,” says the Lord YHWH, “surely because my <span class='hl-2'>sheep</span> became a prey, and my <span class='hl-2'>sheep</span> <span class='hl-3'>became food</span> to all the <span class='hl-1'>animals of the field</span> ..."
verse="Ezekiel 34:5,8"
%}
</div>

### The Calendar

The Book of Enoch is the only place in Scripture where the calendar is given. See Enoch chapters [72](https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#72) to [80](https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#80).

When describing the feast days, the books of Torah assumed that the readers were already familiar with the calendar. This makes sense when we consider that the Book of Enoch had already been written a long time before Moses received the Torah.

#### 30-Day Months

In Enoch the calendar is described as being divided into 12 months of 30 days each, totaling 360 days, plus four intercalary days that divide the year:

{% include verse.html
text="... and for the **three hundred and sixty (days)** there are heads over thousands who divide the days; and for the **four intercalary days** there are the leaders which sunder the four parts of the year."
verse="Enoch 82:11"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="And the year is accurately completed in conformity with their world-stations and the stations of the sun, which rise from the portals through which it (the sun) rises and sets **30 days**."
verse="Enoch 74:17"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="... the reckoning of all their days in which the sun traverses the heaven, entering into and departing from the portals for **thirty days** with the heads of thousands of the order of the stars, together with the **four which are intercalated** which divide the four portions of the year ..."
verse="Enoch 82:4"
%}

A month is also 30 days in the canon:

<div class="columns">
{% include verse.html
text="In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in **the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month**, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst open, and the sky’s windows opened."
verse="Genesis 7:11"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="The waters continually receded from the earth. **After the end of one hundred fifty days** the waters receded. The ship rested in the **seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month**, on Ararat’s mountains."
verse="Genesis 8:3-4"
%}
</div>
<p class="caption">
150 days passed. Two days later (accounting for intercalary days in months 3 and 6) marked the completion of 5 months. This is not possible in the lunar calendar, based on moon cycles, where each month has 29.5 days on average. Five months in that system would be 147 or 148 days.
</p>

{% capture months %}
1260 days divided by 42 months is 30 days per month. See also {% include inline-verse.html verse="Revelation 12:6,14" text-after="." %}
{% endcapture %}
{% include verse.html
text="They will tread the holy city under foot for **forty-two months**. I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy **one thousand two hundred sixty days**, clothed in sackcloth."
verse="Revelation 11:2-3"
caption=months
%}

It is really incredible that Scripture is so consistent with itself!

### The Law

Consistent with other Scripture (and the words of Messiah), in Enoch the law is eternal. See [my study on the law](/the-law-remains/#was-the-law-temporary).

### Dan

{% include verse.html
text="When Abram heard that his relative was taken captive, he led out his three hundred eighteen trained men, born in his house, and pursued as far as **Dan**."
verse="Genesis 14:14"

It has been remarked[^dan] that the mention of "Dan" here is anachronistic, as the allocation for the tribe of Dan did not yet exist, nor did the city of Dan (see {% include inline-verse.html verse="Judges 18:29" text-after=")." %} Interestingly, Enoch also mentions this place called Dan!

[^dan]: See for example [here](https://puritanboard.com/threads/scribal-replacement-of-place-name-in-genesis-14-14.46579/) and [here](https://www.tektonics.org/af/anachronisms.php).

{% include verse.html
text="And I went off and sat down at the waters of **Dan**, in the land of <strong>Dan</strong>, to the south of the west of Hermon"
verse="Enoch 13:7"

### Scriptural Geography

There are other geographical descriptions in Enoch that are very consistent with Scripture. I've explored this aspect as part of my study on [Terre de Iesso](/speculation-terre-de-iesso).
