This is not an exhaustive compilation of evidence, but only what I've personally made a note of in my study of the Book of Enoch.

## The Strongest Evidence

{% include verse.html
text="It was also about these that **Enoch**, in the seventh generation from Adam, prophesied, saying, <strong>“See, the Lord is coming with ten thousands of his holy ones, to execute judgment on all and to convict all the ungodly of all the deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him.”</strong>"
verse="Jude 14-15"
%}

Jude quotes not from anywhere in the canon, but from the Book of Enoch:

{% include verse.html
text="And behold! He cometh with ten thousands of His holy ones To execute judgement upon all, And to destroy all the ungodly: And to convict all flesh Of all the works of their ungodliness which they have ungodly committed, And of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him."
verse="Enoch 1:9"
url="https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#1"
%}

---

Yeshua also apparently referred to Enoch as authoritative, even as Scripture:

{% include verse.html
text="Jesus answered them, “You are wrong because you know neither the **scriptures** nor the power of God. For in the resurrection people neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like angels of God in heaven."
verse="Matthew 22:29-30"
%}

The canonical scriptures do not speak about angels marrying. The only place I know of where this is addressed is Enoch:

{% include verse.html
text="And therefore I have not appointed wives for you; for as for the spiritual ones of the heaven, in heaven is their dwelling."
verse="Enoch 15:7"
url="https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#15"
%}

By saying that the Sadduccees [Zadokites] did not know the scriptures, it would seem that Messiah was implicitly affirming that Enoch is indeed scripture.

## Direct Quotes in Canon

Here are some more instances where the canonical books seem to quote almost verbatim from Enoch:

---

<div class="columns">

text="But for the elect there shall be light and joy and peace, And they shall inherit the earth."
verse="Enoch 5:7"

text="Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth."

{% include verse.html
text="woe to that one by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that one not to have been born."

{% include verse.html
text="And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them, and all were judged according to what they had done."

## References in Scripture

{% include verse.html
text="When people began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born to them, the sons of God saw that they were fair, and they took wives for themselves of all that they chose. [...] The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when **the sons of God went in to the daughters of humans,** who bore children to them. These were the heroes that were of old, warriors of renown."
verse="Genesis 6:1-2,4"
%}

This account in Genesis doesn't elaborate on who the sons of God are, which has led to much speculation about these verses. It seems that the writer of Genesis was assuming familiarity with an existing tradition -- possibly the book written by Enoch before the flood.

{% include verse.html
text="And it came to pass when the children of men had multiplied that in those days were born unto them beautiful and comely daughters. And **the angels, the children of the heaven,** saw and lusted after them, and said to one another: 'Come, let us choose us wives from among the children of men and beget us children.'"
verse="Enoch 6:1-3"
url="https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#6"
%}

The sons of God being angels is consistent with other Scripture:

{% include verse.html
text="Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before YHWH, and Satan also came among them."
verse="Job 1:6"
version="NASB1995"
%}

---

{% include verse.html
text="And the angels who did not keep their own position but deserted their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains in deepest darkness for the judgment of the great day."
verse="Jude 6"
%}

What Jude is referring to is not found in canon, but in Enoch:

{% include verse.html
text="bind them [fallen Watchers] fast for seventy generations in the valleys of the earth, till the day of their judgement and of their consummation, till the judgement that is for ever and ever is consummated."
verse="Enoch 10:12-13"
url="https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#10"
%}

---

{% include verse.html
text="but the goat on which the lot fell for Azazel shall be presented alive before YHWH to make atonement over it, that it may be sent away into the wilderness to Azazel."
verse="Leviticus 16:10"
%}

Who is the Azazel mentioned in Scripture? It is never explained, because readers would have been already familiar with the Book of Enoch (written before Leviticus):

{% include verse.html
text="And the whole earth has been corrupted through the works that were taught by Azazel: to him ascribe all sin."
verse="Enoch 10:8-9"
url="https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#10"
%}

## Other Points of Interest

### The Animal Prophecy

Enoch chapters [85](https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#85) to [90](https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#90) contain an epic prophecy about the history of the chosen people. As it's a long prophecy, I will not reproduce it here. But the interesting thing is that there are at least two sections in the canon that are remarkably similar to Enoch's animal prophecy: {% include inline-verse.html verse="Isaiah 56:9-12" %} and {% include inline-verse.html verse="Ezekiel 34" text-after="." %} I also won't reproduce these here, but I recommend studying them and comparing them to Enoch.

### The Calendar

The Book of Enoch is the only place in Scripture where the calendar is given. See Enoch chapters [72](https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#72) to [80](https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#80).

When describing the feast days, the books of Torah assumed that the readers were already familiar with the calendar. This makes sense when we consider that the Book of Enoch had already been written a long time before Moses received the Torah.

### Dan

{% include verse.html
text="When Abram heard that his nephew had been taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred eighteen of them, and went in pursuit as far as **Dan**."
verse="Genesis 14:14"
%}

It has been remarked[^dan] that the mention of "Dan" here is anachronistic, as the allocation for the tribe of Dan did not yet exist, nor did the city of Dan (see {% include inline-verse.html verse="Judges 18:29" text-after=")." %} Interestingly, Enoch also mentions this place called Dan!

[^dan]: See for example [here](https://puritanboard.com/threads/scribal-replacement-of-place-name-in-genesis-14-14.46579/) and [here](https://www.tektonics.org/af/anachronisms.php).

{% include verse.html
text="And I went off and sat down at the waters of **Dan**, in the land of <strong>Dan</strong>, to the south of the west of Hermon"
verse="Enoch 13:7"

### Scriptural Geography

There are other geographical descriptions in Enoch that are very consistent with Scripture. I've explored this aspect as part of my study on [Terre de Iesso](/speculation-terre-de-iesso).
