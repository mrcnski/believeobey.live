This is not an exhaustive compilation of evidence, but only what I've personally made a note of in my study of the Book of Enoch.

## The Strongest Evidence

{% include verse.html
text="It was also about these that **Enoch**, in the seventh generation from Adam, prophesied, saying, <strong>“See, the Lord is coming with ten thousands of his holy ones, to execute judgment on all and to convict all the ungodly of all the deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him.”</strong>"
verse="Jude 14-15"
%}

Jude quotes not from anywhere in the canon, but from the Book of Enoch:

{% include verse.html
text="And behold! He cometh with ten thousands of His holy ones To execute judgement upon all, And to destroy all the ungodly: And to convict all flesh Of all the works of their ungodliness which they have ungodly committed, And of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him."
verse="Enoch 1:9"

%}

---

Yeshua also apparently referred to Enoch as authoritative, even as Scripture:

{% include verse.html
text="Jesus answered them, “You are wrong because you know neither the **scriptures** nor the power of God. For in the resurrection people neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like angels of God in heaven."
verse="Matthew 22:29-30"
%}

The canonical scriptures do not speak about angels marrying. The only place I know of where this is addressed is Enoch:

{% include verse.html
text="And therefore I have not appointed wives for you; for as for the spiritual ones of the heaven, in heaven is their dwelling."
verse="Enoch 15:7"
url="https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#15"
%}

By saying that the Sadduccees [Zadokites] did not know the scriptures, it would seem that Messiah was implicitly affirming that Enoch is indeed scripture.

## Direct Quotes in Canon

Here are some more instances where the canonical books seem to quote almost verbatim from Enoch:

---

{% include verse.html
text="But for the elect there shall be light and joy and peace, And they shall inherit the earth."
verse="Enoch 5:7"
url="https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#5"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="Blessed are the resting ones, for they will inherit the earth."
verse="Matthew 5:5"

{% include verse.html
text="But the meek shall inherit the land and delight themselves in abundant prosperity."
verse="Psalm 37:11"

verse="Enoch 38:2"
url="https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#38"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="woe to that one by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that one not to have been born."
verse="Matthew 26:24"

{% include verse.html
text="And in those days shall the earth also give back that which has been entrusted to it, And Sheol also shall give back that which it has received, And hell shall give back that which it owes."
verse="Enoch 51:1"
url="https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#51"

{% include verse.html
text="And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them, and all were judged according to what they had done."
verse="Revelation 20:13"
%}

## References in Scripture

{% include verse.html
text="And the angels who did not keep their own position but deserted their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains in deepest darkness for the judgment of the great day."
verse="Jude 6"
%}

What Jude is referring to is not found in canon, but in Enoch:

{% include verse.html
text="bind them [fallen Watchers] fast for seventy generations in the valleys of the earth, till the day of their judgement and of their consummation, till the judgement that is for ever and ever is consummated."
verse="Enoch 10:12-13"
url="https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#10"
%}

---

{% include verse.html
text="but the goat on which the lot fell for Azazel shall be presented alive before YHWH to make atonement over it, that it may be sent away into the wilderness to Azazel."
verse="Leviticus 16:10"
%}

Who is the Azazel mentioned in Scripture? It is never explained, because readers would have been already familiar with the Book of Enoch (written before Leviticus):

{% include verse.html
text="And the whole earth has been corrupted through the works that were taught by Azazel: to him ascribe all sin."
verse="Enoch 10:8-9"
url="https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#10"
%}

### The Seven Spirits

There is a mystery that is not really answered in the canon: who or what are the seven spirits?

{% include verse.html
text="and in front of the throne burn seven flaming torches, which are the seven spirits of God ..."
verse="Revelation 4:5"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="Then I saw between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders a Lamb standing as if it had been slaughtered, with seven horns and seven eyes, which are the **seven spirits of God** sent out into all the earth."
verse="Revelation 5:6"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="For on the stone that I have set before Joshua, **on a single stone with seven facets,** I will engrave its inscription, says the Lord of hosts, and I will remove the guilt of this land in a single day."
verse="Zechariah 3:9"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="These seven are the eyes of YHWH that range through the whole earth."
verse="Zechariah 4:10"
%}

Interestingly, in Enoch there are seven archangels:

{% include verse.html
text="And these are the names of the holy angels who watch. <strong>Uriel</strong>, one of the holy angels, who is over the world and over Tartarus. <strong>Raphael</strong>, one of the holy angels, who is over the spirits of men. <strong>Raguel</strong>, one of the holy angels who takes vengeance on the world of the luminaries. <strong>Michael</strong>, one of the holy angels, to wit, he that is set over the best part of mankind and over chaos. <strong>Saraqael</strong>, one of the holy angels, who is set over the spirits, who sin in the spirit. <strong>Gabriel</strong>, one of the holy angels, who is over Paradise and the serpents and the Cherubim. <strong>Remiel</strong>, one of the holy angels, whom God set over those who rise."
verse="Enoch 20"
url="https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#20"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="And those **seven holy ones** brought me and placed me on the earth before the door of my house ..."
verse="Enoch 81:5"
url="https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#81"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="And I raised mine eyes again to heaven, and I saw in the vision, and behold there came forth from heaven beings who were like white men: and four went forth from that place and three with them."
verse="Enoch 87:2-3"
url="https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#87"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="And the Lord called those men **the seven first white ones,** and commanded that they should bring before Him..."
verse="Enoch 90:21"

## Other Points of Interest

### The Animal Prophecy

Enoch chapters [85](https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#85) to [90](https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#90) contain an epic prophecy about the history of the chosen people. As it's a long prophecy, I will not reproduce it here. But the interesting thing is that there are at least two sections in the canon that are remarkably similar to Enoch's animal prophecy: {% include inline-verse.html verse="Isaiah 56:9-12" %} and {% include inline-verse.html verse="Ezekiel 34" text-after="." %} I also won't reproduce these here, but I recommend studying them and comparing them to Enoch.

### The Calendar

The Book of Enoch is the only place in Scripture where the calendar is given. See Enoch chapters [72](https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#72) to [80](https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#80).

When describing the feast days, the books of Torah assumed that the readers were already familiar with the calendar. This makes sense when we consider that the Book of Enoch had already been written a long time before Moses received the Torah.

### Dan

{% include verse.html
text="When Abram heard that his nephew had been taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred eighteen of them, and went in pursuit as far as **Dan**."
verse="Genesis 14:14"
%}

It has been remarked[^dan] that the mention of "Dan" here is anachronistic, as the allocation for the tribe of Dan did not yet exist, nor did the city of Dan (see {% include inline-verse.html verse="Judges 18:29" text-after=")." %} Interestingly, Enoch also mentions this place called Dan!

[^dan]: See for example [here](https://puritanboard.com/threads/scribal-replacement-of-place-name-in-genesis-14-14.46579/) and [here](https://www.tektonics.org/af/anachronisms.php).

{% include verse.html
text="And I went off and sat down at the waters of **Dan**, in the land of <strong>Dan</strong>, to the south of the west of Hermon"
verse="Enoch 13:7"
%}
