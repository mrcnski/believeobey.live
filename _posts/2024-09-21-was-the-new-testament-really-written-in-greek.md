title: "Was the New Testament Really Written in Greek?"

There is an abundance of evidence that Greek was **not** the original language of most, if not all of the New Testament. This is important to understand: since the Greek texts were a *translation* from either Hebrew or Aramaic, the Greek contains many errors that were introduced in the translation process. A great illustration of why this is so critical is {% include inline-verse.html verse="Mark 7:19" %} where the Greek has Yeshua declaring all foods clean, contradicting verses like {% include inline-verse.html verse="Matthew 5:17-19" text-after="," %} {% include inline-verse.html verse="Isaiah 66:3" text-after="," %} {% include inline-verse.html verse="Revelation 18:2" text-after="," %} etc.

{% include image.html name="aramaic-clean.png" alt="Yeshua did not declare all foods clean." caption="Mark 7:19 in the Aramaic AENT. Yeshua said He would not abolish the Law, and certainly He did not contradict Himself here." width="741" %}

I would highly recommend reading the Aramaic New Testament instead, which is based on much more accurate source material. Please email me if you'd like help finding the Aramaic New Testament.

I may update this page over time. For now, I'm only including a couple of excerpts from the book "Was the New Testament Really Written in Greek?". Note that I don't necessarily agree with everything stated in the book or in these excerpts -- as always, test everything!

The book is out of print, but seems to be available [here](https://archive.org/details/WastheNewTestamentReallyWritteninGreek1e). I didn't get it from there, and I'm not sure about the legality of downloading it from there. The original website seems to have been [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20090316103840/http://www.aramaicpeshitta.com/downloadbook.htm).
