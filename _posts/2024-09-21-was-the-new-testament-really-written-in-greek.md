title: "Was the New Testament Really Written in Greek?"
---

There is an abundance of evidence that Greek was **not** the original language of most, if not all of the New Testament. I may update this page over time. For now, I'm only including a couple of excerpts from the book "Was the New Testament Really Written in Greek?" Note that I don't necessarily agree with everything stated in the book or in these excerpts -- as always, test everything!

The book is out of print, but seems to be available [here](https://archive.org/details/WastheNewTestamentReallyWritteninGreek1e). I didn't get it from there, and I'm not sure about the legality of downloading it from there. The original website seems to have been [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20090316103840/http://www.aramaicpeshitta.com/downloadbook.htm).
