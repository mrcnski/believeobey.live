There is an abundance of evidence that Greek was **not** the original language of most, if not all of the New Testament. This is important to understand: since the Greek texts were a *translation* from either Hebrew or Aramaic, the Greek contains many errors that were introduced in the translation process. A great illustration of why this is so critical is {% include inline-verse.html verse="Mark 7:19" %} where the Greek has Yeshua declaring all foods clean, contradicting verses like {% include inline-verse.html verse="Matthew 5:17-19" text-after="," %} {% include inline-verse.html verse="Isaiah 66:3" text-after="," %} {% include inline-verse.html verse="Revelation 18:2" version="NASB1995" text-after="," %} etc.

{% include image.html name="aramaic-clean.png" alt="Yeshua did not declare all foods clean." caption="Mark 7:19 in the Aramaic AENT [Murdock translation]. Yeshua said He would not abolish the Law, and certainly He did not contradict Himself here." width="741" %}

I would highly recommend reading the Aramaic New Testament instead of the Greek, as the Aramaic is much more accurate in many ways. Please see "Where to Read the Aramaic?" below.

I encourage everybody to think for themselves regarding "Greek primacy".

## Where to Read the Aramaic?

If you would like a print version, Lamsa's translation of the Aramaic is on Amazon. It has the sacred names in standard English.

You can also view that translation, as well as other public domain translations like Murdock's, by going to [dukhrana.com](https://dukhrana.com) and clicking on "Peshitta Tool".

Here is a new print translation, though me and my colleagues haven't read this one and can't vouch for it:
