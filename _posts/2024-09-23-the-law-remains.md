There's a popular idea that the Law of Moses was replaced, or does not apply to Christians anymore. I wrestled with this for a long time, but I couldn't get around the fact that Scripture explicitly tells us otherwise:

{% include verse.html
text="Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded to him in Horeb for all Israel, even statutes and ordinances."
verse="Malachi 4:4"
%}

{% include image.html name="the-law-remains-1.jpeg" alt="The Law Remains" width="741" %}

## Torah Not Abolished

God clearly told us what He expects from us. The Law of Christ is not some vague, nebulous thing that every modern sect of Christianity gets to define differently. The Law of Christ is, in fact, the written Torah magnified:

{% include verse.html
text="**Don’t think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets. I didn’t come to destroy, but to fulfill.** For most certainly, I tell you, **until heaven and earth pass away**, not even one smallest letter or one tiny pen stroke shall in any way pass away from the law, until all things are accomplished. Therefore, whoever shall break one of these least commandments and teach others to do so, shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven; but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven."
verse="Matthew 5:17-19"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="It pleased YHWH, for his righteousness’ sake, to **magnify the law** and make it honorable."
verse="Isaiah 42:21"
%}

Not only do the "least" of the commandments remain relevant, but they have been *magnified*! In other words, rather than abolishing any laws, Yeshua taught their full meaning ({% include inline-verse.html verse="Matthew 7:12" text-after=")." %}

---

Do the above verses only refer to Israel? What about Gentiles?

{% include verse.html
text="Also the **foreigners who join themselves to YHWH** to serve him, and to love YHWH’s name, to be his servants, **everyone who keeps the Sabbath from profaning it, and holds fast my covenant**, I will bring these to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my altar; for my house will be called a house of prayer for all peoples.” The Lord YHWH, who gathers the outcasts of Israel, says, **“I will yet gather others to him, in addition to his own who are gathered.”**"
verse="Isaiah 56:6-8"
%}

I don't know of any support in the prophets for multiple laws. Rather, there is one Law that foreigners must observe, and one covenant to be under.

{% include verse.html
text="One law shall be to him who is born at home, and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner among you."
verse="Exodus 12:49"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="You shall have one kind of law for the foreigner as well as the native-born; for I am YHWH your God."
verse="Leviticus 24:22"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner, **a statute forever throughout your generations**. As you are, so the foreigner shall be before YHWH. **One law and one ordinance shall be for you and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner with you.**"
verse="Numbers 15:15-16"
%}

This shows that converted Gentiles are not under a different law, or no law at all. I don't believe there is any support for that in the Hebrew Scriptures.

---

What about the new covenant?

{% include verse.html
text="“But this is **the covenant** that I will make with the house of Israel after those days,” says YHWH: “**I will put my law in their inward parts, and I will write it in their heart**. I will be their God, and they shall be my people."
verse="Jeremiah 31:33"
%}

It seems that the Law is part of the new covenant!

{% include verse.html
text="I will also give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit within you. I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. **I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes. You will keep my ordinances and do them.**"
verse="Ezekiel 36:26-27"
%}

### Some More Scriptures

{% include verse.html
text="Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but **only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven**. On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’ Then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; go away from me, you who behave **lawlessly**.’"

In the <a href="https://www.hebrewgospels.com/_files/ugd/c68db9_aad134a8a148455c99c979c6fe69e0b6.pdf">Hebrew version of James</a> it is the "law of joy".

verse="James 1:24-25"
caption=joy
%}

Torah is perfect (*"YHWH’s law is perfect, restoring the soul"* - {% include inline-verse.html verse="Psalm 19:7" text-after=")" %} and the law of freedom/joy. This passage teaches the same thing as Deuteronomy -- that obedience leads to blessings:

{% include verse.html
text="It shall happen, if you shall listen diligently to YHWH your God’s voice, to observe to do all his commandments which I command you today, that YHWH your God will set you high above all the nations of the earth. All these blessings will come upon you, and overtake you, if you listen to YHWH your God’s voice."

For he who said, “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not commit murder.” Now if you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. **So speak and so do as men who are to be judged by the law of freedom.** For judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment."

Is James teaching lawlessness, or the magnification of the law?

## The "Least" of the Commandments

Man has a deceitful heart (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2017:9&version=WEB">Jeremiah 17:9</a>),[^deceitful] and can convince himself that he is obedient, even when he is picking and choosing commandments that he likes and ignoring the ones that he doesn't like.

[^deceitful]: This verse reads differently in the <a href="https://biblehub.com/sep/jeremiah/17.htm">Septuagint</a>. Your author personally thinks that there is important truth in the Hebrew version.

As Yeshua told us, even the "least" of the commandments still apply. Many Christians ignore the Sabbath law (the fourth commandment!) and the food laws -- is this a Biblical attitude?

This was written after Yeshua's death, yet there are still unclean animals.

## Torah in the Kingdom and Beyond

We've read that until heaven and earth pass away, not one stroke from Torah is done away with. We can see Torah being kept after Yeshua's death and return:

<div class="columns">
{% include verse.html
text="It shall happen in the latter days, that the mountain of YHWH’s house shall be established on the top of the mountains, and shall be raised above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it. Many peoples shall go and say, “Come, let’s go up to the mountain of YHWH, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths.” **For the law shall go out of Zion, and YHWH’s word from Jerusalem.**"
verse="Isaiah 2:2-3"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="But in the latter days, it will happen that the mountain of YHWH’s temple will be established on the top of the mountains, and it will be exalted above the hills; and peoples will stream to it. Many nations will go and say, “Come! Let’s go up to the mountain of YHWH, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths.” **For the law will go out of Zion, and YHWH’s word from Jerusalem**;"
verse="Micah 4:1-2"
%}
</div>

Two things go forth: Torah, and the word of the Lord. This reminds us of the two prerequisites of a saint that we saw above in Revelation 12:17 and Revelation 14:12.

{% include verse.html
text="“For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me,” says YHWH, “so your offspring and your name shall remain. It shall happen that from one new moon to another, and **from one Sabbath to another, all flesh will come to worship before me**,” says YHWH."
verse="Isaiah 66:22-23"

{% include verse.html
text="It will happen that everyone who is left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, YHWH of Armies, and to keep the **feast of booths**. It will be that whoever of all the families of the earth doesn’t go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, YHWH of Armies, on them there will be no rain. If the family of Egypt doesn’t go up and doesn’t come, neither will it rain on them. This will be the plague with which YHWH will strike the nations that don’t go up to keep the **feast of booths**."
verse="Zechariah 14:16-18"
%}

All the nations, not just Israel, were expected to keep the yearly pilgrimage festival to Jerusalem that's commanded in Torah. As we saw in {% include inline-verse.html verse="Isaiah 56:6-8" text-after="," %} Torah was *not* just for Israel.

## Was the Law Temporary?

{% include verse.html
text="All of your words are truth. Every one of your righteous ordinances endures **forever**."
verse="Psalm 119:160"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="YHWH spoke to Moses, saying, “Speak also to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Most certainly you shall keep my Sabbaths; for it is a sign between me and you **throughout your generations**, that you may know that I am YHWH who sanctifies you. You shall keep the Sabbath therefore, for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to YHWH. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day shall surely be put to death. Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath **throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant**. It is a **sign between me and the children of Israel forever**; for in six days YHWH made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.’”"
verse="Exodus 31:12-17"
%}

The Sabbath is to be observed "forever". This shouldn't surprise us -- it goes all the way back to the creation week![^eternal]

[^eternal]: Some might say that the Hebrew word {% include concordance-hebrew.html number="5769" text="*olam*" %} does not necessarily mean "perpetual" or "forever", and could just mean "a very long time" or "until the end of the age". This may be true in some cases, but as Yeshua told us in Matthew 5:18, the law is "until heaven and earth pass away". We see in Enoch below that the law is "for all generations"!

{% include verse.html
text="At that time, Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the grain fields. His disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat. But the Pharisees, when they saw it, said to him, “Behold, your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.” But he said to them, “Haven’t you read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him: how he entered into God’s house and ate the show bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests? Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath day the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless? But I tell you that one greater than the temple is here. But if you had known what this means, ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,’ you wouldn’t have condemned the guiltless. For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”"
verse="Matthew 12:1-8"
%}

It is tempting to impose our own interpretations on these verses, but we must be careful not to do that. To say that Yeshua did away with the Sabbath here would contradict the bulk of scripture, nor does this even say that.

If we take this at face value, David was in an emergency situation where he had to break the Sabbath or die, and God didn't hold him guilty. That's all this says.

By the way, He says here that He is lord of the Sabbath, not of Sunday. The Lord's Day is Sabbath.
