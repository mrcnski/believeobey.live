All three gospels go on to talk about the Transfiguration, which is why I've included the context of what Yeshua was talking about: coming back in power and glory, with angels. That's not the Transfiguration, nor was this fulfilled at Pentecost.

It is true that in the Aramaic, the word for "generation" can also mean "tribe" or "people". This verse is included in this study for completeness; and besides, we do know from the rest of this study that "this generation" really was the correct meaning here, and not "this tribe".

text="No, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel: ‘In the last days it will be, God declares, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams. Even upon my slaves, both men and women, in those days I will pour out my Spirit, and they shall prophesy. And I will show portents in the heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood, and fire, and smoky mist. The sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood, **before the coming of the Lord’s great and glorious day**. Then everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.’"
verse="Acts 2:16-21"

Peter clearly believed he was living during the fulfillment of Joel's prophecy {% include inline-verse.html verse="Joel 2:28-32" text-before="(" text-after=")" %} and of the day of the Lord in the "last days".

{% include verse.html
text="After the sixty-two weeks, an anointed one shall be cut off and shall have nothing, and the troops of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end shall come with a flood, and to the end there shall be war. Desolations are decreed. He shall make a strong covenant with many for one week, and for half of the week he shall make sacrifice and offering cease, and in their place shall be a desolating sacrilege until the decreed end is poured out upon the desolator."
verse="Daniel 9:26-27"
%}

Here we see that the desolating sacrilege and the one-week tribulation were fulfilled at the destruction of Jerusalem ("the city and the sanctuary") after the crucifixion ("an anointed one shall be cut off"). It is interesting to cross-reference this with Revelation 12:14-15, which was another prophecy about the same time (and which also mentions a flood):

{% include verse.html
text="But the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle, so that she could fly from the serpent into the wilderness, to her place where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time. Then from his mouth the serpent poured water like a river after the woman, to sweep her away with the flood."
verse="Revelation 12:14-15"

text="See, the day is coming, burning like an oven, when all the arrogant and all evildoers will be stubble; the day that comes shall burn them up, says the Lord of hosts, so that it will leave them neither root nor branch. But for you who revere my name the sun of righteousness shall rise, with healing in its wings. You shall go out leaping like calves from the stall. And you shall tread down the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet, on the day when I act, says the Lord of hosts. Remember the teaching of my servant Moses, the statutes and ordinances that I commanded him at Horeb for all Israel. See, **I will send you the prophet Elijah before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes**. He will turn the hearts of parents to their children and the hearts of children to their parents, so that I will not come and strike the land with a curse."
verse="Malachi 4"
%}

This short chapter is an amazing fulfilled prophecy. Here we can clearly see the coming of Elijah associated with the "day of the Lord". This was fulfilled in John the Baptist. "Leaping like calves from the stall" reminds us of the disciples when Yeshua sent them out. "You shall tread down the wicked" was fulfilled in Luke 10:19:

{% include verse.html
text="Indeed, I have given you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing will hurt you."
verse="Luke 10:19"
%}

**Update:** Since writing the above I've found the following verses, confirming that my understanding was correct. These verses explicitly say that John the Baptist was Elijah who would "turn the hearts of parents to their children", as prophesied by Malachi.

{% include verse.html
text="He [John] will turn many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God. <strong>With the spirit and power of Elijah</strong> he will go before him, to **turn the hearts of parents to their children** and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."

The word "soon" is Strong's G5035:

G5035   (Strong)
ταχύ
tachu
takh-oo'

> Neuter singular of G5036 (as adverb); shortly, that is, **without delay**, soon, or (by surprise) suddenly, or (by implication of ease) readily: - lightly, quickly.

Note that there is no Scriptural basis for the "suddenly" definition. Confirm it for yourself with a [concordance](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5035/kjv/tr/0-1/)!

Contrast this with Daniel 12:4. It seems that Revelation was written for the generation that received it.

verse="Matthew 24:2-3"
%}

I have heard *claims* that the disciples were asking three separate questions: when will the temple be destroyed, what will be the sign of Yeshua's coming (or presence), and what is the sign of the end of the age? After this Bible study, however, we can see that these three things were to happen around the same time.
