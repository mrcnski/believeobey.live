The writers of Matthew and Mark go on to talk about the Transfiguration, which is why I've included the context of what Yeshua was talking about: coming back in power and glory, with angels. That's not the Transfiguration, nor was this fulfilled at Pentecost.

It is true that in the Aramaic, the word for "generation" can also mean "tribe" or "people". This verse is included in this study for completeness; and besides, we do know from the rest of this study that "this generation" really was the correct meaning here, and not "this tribe".

{% include verse.html
text="After the sixty-two weeks the Anointed One will be cut off, and will have nothing. The people of the prince who come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end will be with a flood, and war will be even to the end. Desolations are determined. He will make a firm covenant with many for one week. In the middle of the week he will cause the sacrifice and the offering to cease. On the wing of abominations will come one who makes desolate; and even to the decreed full end, wrath will be poured out on the desolate."
verse="Daniel 9:26-27"
%}

Here we see that the desolating sacrilege and the one-week tribulation were fulfilled at the destruction of Jerusalem ("the city and the sanctuary") after the crucifixion ("an anointed one shall be cut off"). It is interesting to cross-reference this with Revelation 12:14-15, which was another prophecy about the same time (and which also mentions a flood):

text="Two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, so that she might be nourished for a time, times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent. The serpent spewed water out of his mouth after the woman like a river, that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream."
verse="Revelation 12:14-15"

text="For behold, the day comes, burning like a furnace, when all the proud and all who work wickedness will be stubble. The day that comes will burn them up, says YHWH of Armies, so that it will leave them neither root nor branch. But to you who fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in its wings. You will go out and leap like calves of the stall. You shall tread down the wicked; for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I make, says YHWH of Armies. Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded to him in Horeb for all Israel, even statutes and ordinances. Behold, **I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of YHWH comes**. He will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the earth with a curse."
verse="Malachi 4"
%}

This short chapter is an amazing fulfilled prophecy. Here we can clearly see the coming of Elijah associated with the "day of the Lord". This was fulfilled in John the Baptist. "Leaping like calves from the stall" reminds us of the disciples when Yeshua sent them out. "You shall tread down the wicked" was fulfilled in Matthew 10:1:

The word "soon" is Strong's G5035:

G5035   (Strong)
ταχύ
tachu
takh-oo'

> Neuter singular of G5036 (as adverb); shortly, that is, **without delay**, soon, or (by surprise) suddenly, or (by implication of ease) readily: - lightly, quickly.

Note that there is no Scriptural basis for the "suddenly" definition. Confirm it for yourself with a [concordance](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5035/kjv/tr/0-1/)!

Contrast this with Daniel 12:4. It seems that Revelation was written for the generation that received it.

text="“You see all of these things, don't you? Most certainly I tell you, there will not be left here one stone on another, that will not be thrown down. As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, 'Tell us, **when will these things be? What is the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?**”"
verse="Matthew 24:2-3"
%}

I have heard claims that the disciples were asking three separate questions: when will the temple be destroyed, what will be the sign of Yeshua's coming (or presence), and what is the sign of the end of the age? After this Bible study, however, we can see that these three things were to happen around the same time.
