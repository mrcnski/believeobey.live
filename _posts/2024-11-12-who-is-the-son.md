## Is YHWH the Father?

Let's start by asking, who is the Father? There is evidence that YHWH is the Father:

{% include verse.html
text="YHWH says to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool for your feet.”"
verse="Psalm 110:1"
%}

It seems that the Father is speaking to the Son here, evidently confirmed by Yeshua in {% include inline-verse.html verse="Matthew 22:42-45" text-after="." %} Here are some more verses:

{% include verse.html
text="For you are our Father, though Abraham doesn’t know us, and Israel does not acknowledge us. **You, YHWH, are our Father.** Our Redeemer from everlasting is your name."
verse="Isaiah 63:16"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="A son honors his father, and a servant his master. **If I am a father**, then where is my honor? And if I am a master, where is the respect due me?” says YHWH of Armies to you priests who despise my name."
verse="Malachi 1:6"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="Is this the way you repay YHWH, foolish and unwise people? Isn’t he your father who has bought you?"
verse="Deuteronomy 32:6"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="... for I am a father to Israel. Ephraim is my firstborn."
verse="Jeremiah 31:9"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="Who has ascended up into heaven, and descended? Who has gathered the wind in his fists? Who has bound the waters in his garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? **What is his name, and what is his son’s name, if you know?**"
verse="Proverbs 30:4"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="I will surely tell of the decree of YHWH: He said to Me, ‘You are My Son, Today I have begotten You."
verse="Psalm 2:7"
version="NASB1995"
%}

In the last verse we see that YHWH is the one who would beget the Son. Is that the full story, though?

## The First and the Last?

{% include verse.html
text="**“I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God**, “who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.”"
verse="Revelation 1:8"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="When I saw him, I fell at his feet like a dead man. He laid his right hand on me, saying, “Don’t be afraid. **I am the first and the last**, and the Living one. I was dead, and behold, I am alive forever and ever."
verse="Revelation 1:17-18"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="“Behold, I am coming soon! My reward is with me, to repay to each man according to his work. **I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.** Blessed are those who do his commandments, that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter in by the gates into the city. Outside are the dogs, the sorcerers, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood. **I, Jesus**, have sent my angel to testify these things to you for the assemblies. I am the root and the offspring of David, the Bright and Morning Star.”"
verse="Revelation 22:12-16"
%}

In the first passage it is perhaps not apparent who is speaking, but in the other two it is evidently Yeshua. It seems safe to say that He identifies as "the first and the last".

Here's where it gets interesting.

{% include verse.html
text="Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel my called: I am he. **I am the first. I am also the last.**"
verse="Isaiah 48:12"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="This is what YHWH, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, YHWH of Armies, says: “**I am the first, and I am the last**; and besides me there is no God."
verse="Isaiah 44:6"
%}

When Yeshua calls Himself "the first and the last" in Revelation, He is referring back to these verses in Isaiah, spoken by YHWH.

## No God Apart from YHWH

In the previous verse from Isaiah, we also saw YHWH saying "besides me there is no god", which we have to reconcile with this:

{% include verse.html
text="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and **the Word was God**."
verse="John 1:1"
%}

... and this:

{% include verse.html
text="Jesus said to them, “Most certainly, I tell you, before Abraham came into existence, **I AM**.”"
verse="John 8:58"
%}

(which reminds us of the meaning of "YHWH").

{% include verse.html
text="See now that I, I am He, And **there is no god besides Me**; It is I who put to death and give life. I have wounded and it is I who heal, And there is no one who can deliver from My hand."
verse="Deuteronomy 32:39"
version="NASB1995"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="I am YHWH. That is my name. **I will not give my glory to another**, nor my praise to engraved images."
verse="Isaiah 42:8"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="For my own sake, for my own sake, I will do it; for how would my name be profaned? **I will not give my glory to another.**"
verse="Isaiah 48:11"
%}

## Whose Name Are We Saved By?

{% include verse.html
text="I myself am YHWH. Besides me, there is no savior."
verse="Isaiah 43:11"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="Declare and present it. Yes, let them take counsel together. Who has shown this from ancient time? Who has declared it of old? Haven’t I, YHWH? **There is no other God besides me, a just God and a Savior.** There is no one besides me. “Look to me, and be saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is no other. I have sworn by myself. The word has gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and will not be revoked, that **to me every knee shall bow**, every tongue shall take an oath."
verse="Isaiah 45:21"
%}

---

{% include verse.html
text="And at that hour that Son of Man was named In the presence of the Lord of Spirits, And his name before the Head of Days. [...] And the wisdom of the Lord of Spirits hath revealed him to the holy and righteous; For he hath preserved the lot of the righteous, Because they have hated and despised this world of unrighteousness, And have hated all its works and ways in the name of the Lord of Spirits: **For in his name they are saved**, And according to his good pleasure hath it been in regard to their life."
verse="Enoch 48:2,7"
url="https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#48"
%}

In the above verse we see that salvation is "in the name of the Lord of Spirits", who is separate from "that Son of Man".

## Does Yeshua Carry the Name?

{% include verse.html
text="I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them through **your name which you have given me**, that they may be one, even as we are. While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name."
verse="John 17:11-12"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="For I tell you, you will not see me from now on, until you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!’”"
verse="Matthew 23:39"
%}

---

{% include verse.html
text="Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in **the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit** ..."
verse="Matthew 28:19"
%}

The above verse clearly shows us that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit all share the name.

I have seen speculation that this verse is an insertion by Trinitarian Catholics, but I've not seen evidence to suggest that. The [Greek](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/mat/28/19/s_957019), [Aramaic](https://dukhrana.com/peshitta/index.php), and [Hebrew](https://www.hebrewgospels.com/matthew) texts all contain this verse. Actually, in this study we've seen numerous examples where the Father and Son seem to share the name of YHWH.

verse="Exodus 23:20-21"
%}

## Who is the Angel of YHWH?

In the previous verse we saw that the angel/messenger (Hebrew: [*malak*](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/430.htm)) will not pardon transgressions. Scripturally, forgiving sins is associated with God (see for example {% include inline-verse.html verse="Daniel 9:9" text-after=")." %} So who is this *malak*?

{% include verse.html
text="**YHWH’s angel** appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the middle of a bush. He looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. Moses said, “I will go now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burned.” **When YHWH saw that he came over to see**, God called to him out of the middle of the bush, and said, “Moses! Moses!” He said, “Here I am.” [...] Go and gather the elders of Israel together, and tell them, ‘**YHWH, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying**, “I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt."
verse="Exodus 3:2-4,16"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="**YHWH’s angel came and sat under the oak which was in Ophrah**, that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite. His son Gideon was beating out wheat in the wine press, to hide it from the Midianites. YHWH’s angel appeared to him, and said to him, “YHWH is with you, you mighty man of valor!” Gideon said to him, “Oh, my lord, if YHWH is with us, why then has all this happened to us? Where are all his wondrous works which our fathers told us of, saying, ‘Didn’t YHWH bring us up from Egypt?’ But now YHWH has cast us off, and delivered us into the hand of Midian.” **YHWH looked at him, and said**, “Go in this your might, and save Israel from the hand of Midian. Haven’t I sent you?”"
verse="Judges 6:11-14"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="For he said, “Surely they are my people, children who will not act deceitfully,” and **he became their savior in all their distress. It was no messenger or angel but his presence that saved them**; in his love and pity it was he who redeemed them; he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old."
verse="Isaiah 63:8-9"
version="NRSVUE"
caption="Other translations differ here, so make sure to compare, but this is really interesting."

text="He said, “**My presence** will go with you, and I will give you rest.” Moses said to him, “If your presence doesn’t go with me, don’t carry us up from here."
verse="Exodus 33:14-15"
%}

---

In the next passage it seems that the angel of YHWH also bears His name:

{% include verse.html
text="He showed me Joshua the high priest standing before **YHWH’s angel**, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary. **YHWH said to Satan, “YHWH rebuke you, Satan!** Yes, YHWH who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Isn’t this a burning stick plucked out of the fire?”"

## Yeshua is Worshipped

{% include verse.html
text="When Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood in front of him with his sword drawn in his hand. Joshua went to him and said to him, “Are you for us, or for our enemies?” He said, “No; but I have come now as commander of YHWH’s army.” **Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshiped**, and asked him, “What does my lord say to his servant?”"
verse="Joshua 5:13-14"
%}

We know this isn't an angel because it is forbidden to worship angels ({% include inline-verse.html verse="Revelation 22:8-9" text-after="," %} {% include inline-verse.html verse="Matthew 4:9-10" text-after=")." %}

On further investigation, "worship" is probably the wrong translation in this passage from Joshua. We see the same word "shâchâh" used in {% include inline-verse.html verse="Genesis 19:1" text-after="," %} where Lot "bows" to two angels. I have kept this section for the sake of completeness.

The word for God here is [*elohim*](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/430.htm), and the word for angel is [*malak*](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/430.htm).

It is interesting to look at [the Strong's for "echad"](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/259.htm). Indeed, it can refer to a unity. We see examples of this in Scripture:
