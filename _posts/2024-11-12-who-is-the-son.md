title: "Who is the Son?"

Let's start by asking, who is the Father? Well, there is evidence that YHWH is the Father:

{% include verse.html
text="YHWH says to my lord, “Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool.”"
verse="Psalm 110:1"
%}

It seems that the Father is speaking to the Son here, evidently confirmed by Yeshua in {% include inline-verse.html verse="Matthew 22:42-45" text-after="." %} Let's look at some more verses:

{% include verse.html
text="For you are our father, though Abraham does not know us and Israel does not acknowledge us; **you, O YHWH, are our father**; our Redeemer from of old is your name."
verse="Isaiah 63:16"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="A son honors his father and a servant his master. **If then I am a father**, where is the honor due me? And if I am a master, where is the respect due me? says YHWH of hosts to you, O priests, who despise my name."
verse="Malachi 1:6"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="I will tell of the decree of YHWH: He said to me, You are my son; today I have begotten you."
verse="Psalm 2:7"
%}

It seems that YHWH is the one who would beget the Son. Is that the full story, though?

## The First and the Last?

{% include verse.html
text="**“I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God**, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty."
verse="Revelation 1:8"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. But he placed his right hand on me, saying, “Do not be afraid; **I am the First and the Last** and the Living One. I was dead, and see, I am alive forever and ever, and I have the keys of Death and of Hades."
verse="Revelation 1:17-18"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="See, I am coming soon; my reward is with me, to repay according to everyone’s work. **I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.** Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they will have the right to the tree of life and may enter the city by the gates. Outside are the dogs and sorcerers and sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood. <strong>It is I, Yeshua</strong>, who sent my angel to you with this testimony for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star."
verse="Revelation 22:12-16"
%}

In the first passage it is perhaps not apparent who is speaking, but in the other two it is evidently Yeshua. It seems safe to say that He identifies as "the first and the last".

Here's where it gets interesting.

{% include verse.html
text="Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel, whom I called: I am he; **I am the first, and I am the last**."
verse="Isaiah 48:12"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="Thus says YHWH, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, YHWH of hosts: **I am the first, and I am the last**; besides me there is no god."
verse="Isaiah 44:6"
%}

When Yeshua calls Himself "the first and the last" in Revelation, He is referring back to these verses in Isaiah, spoken by YHWH.

## No God Apart from YHWH

In the previous verse from Isaiah, we also saw YHWH saying "besides me there is no god", which we have to reconcile with this:

{% include verse.html
text="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and **the Word was God**."
verse="John 1:1"
%}

... and this:

{% include verse.html
text="Yeshua said to them, “Very truly, I tell you, before Abraham was, **I am**.”"
verse="John 8:58"
%}

(which reminds us of the meaning of "YHWH").

{% include verse.html
text="See now that I, even I, am he; **there is no god besides me**. I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal; and no one can deliver from my hand."
verse="Deuteronomy 32:39"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="I am YHWH; that is my name; **my glory I give to no other**, nor my praise to idols."
verse="Isaiah 42:8"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="For my own sake, for my own sake, I do it, for why should my name be profaned? **My glory I will not give to another.**"
verse="Isaiah 48:11"
%}

## Whose Name Are We Saved By?

{% include verse.html
text="I, I am YHWH, and besides me there is no savior."
verse="Isaiah 43:11"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="Declare and present your case; take counsel together! Who told this long ago? Who declared it of old? Was it not I, YHWH? **There is no other god besides me, a righteous God and a Savior; there is no one besides me.** Turn to me and be saved, all the ends of the earth! For I am God, and there is no other. By myself I have sworn; from my mouth has gone forth in righteousness a word that shall not return: <strong>“To me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.”</strong>"
verse="Isaiah 45:21"
%}

---

{% include verse.html
text="And at that hour that Son of Man was named In the presence of the Lord of Spirits, And his name before the Head of Days. [...] And the wisdom of the Lord of Spirits hath revealed him to the holy and righteous; For he hath preserved the lot of the righteous, Because they have hated and despised this world of unrighteousness, And have hated all its works and ways in the name of the Lord of Spirits: **For in his name they are saved**, And according to his good pleasure hath it been in regard to their life."
verse="Enoch 48:2,7"
url="https://parallel.thebookofenoch.info/#48"
%}

In the above verse we see that salvation is "in the name of the Lord of Spirits".

## Does Yeshua Carry the Name?

{% include verse.html
text="And now I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them in your name that you have given me, so that they may be one, as we are one. **While I was with them, I protected them in your name that you have given me.**"
verse="John 17:11-12"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, ‘Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord.’"
verse="Matthew 23:39"
%}

---

{% include verse.html
text="Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in **the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit** ..."
verse="Matthew 28:19"
%}

The above verse clearly shows us that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit all share *the* name.

Some people don't like this verse and have suggested that it's an insertion by Trinitarian Catholics, but there's no evidence to suggest that. The [Greek](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/mat/28/19/s_957019), [Aramaic](https://dukhrana.com/peshitta/index.php), and [Hebrew](https://www.hebrewgospels.com/matthew) texts all contain this verse. Actually, in this study we've seen numerous examples where the Father and Son seem to share the name of YHWH.

verse="Exodus 23:20-21"
%}

## Who is the Angel of YHWH?

In the previous verse we saw that the angel/messenger (Hebrew: malak) will not pardon transgressions. Scripturally, forgiving sins is associated with God (see for example {% include inline-verse.html verse="Daniel 9:9" text-after=")." %} So who is this malak?

{% include verse.html
text="There **the angel of YHWH** appeared to him in a flame of fire out of a bush; he looked, and the bush was blazing, yet it was not consumed. Then Moses said, “I must turn aside and look at this great sight and see why the bush is not burned up.” <strong>When YHWH saw that he had turned aside to see</strong>, God called to him out of the bush, “Moses, Moses!” And he said, “Here I am.” [...] Go and assemble the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘<strong>YHWH, the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, has appeared to me</strong>, saying: I have given heed to you and to what has been done to you in Egypt."
verse="Exodus 3:2-4,16"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="<strong>Now the angel of YHWH came and sat under the oak at Ophrah</strong>, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, as his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites. The angel of YHWH appeared to him and said to him, “YHWH is with you, you mighty warrior.” Gideon answered him, “But sir, if YHWH is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all his wonderful deeds that our ancestors recounted to us, saying, ‘Did not YHWH bring us up from Egypt?’ But now YHWH has cast us off and given us into the hand of Midian.” **Then YHWH turned to him and said**, “Go in this might of yours and deliver Israel from the hand of Midian; I hereby commission you.”"
verse="Judges 6:11-14"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="For he said, “Surely they are my people, children who will not act deceitfully,” and **he became their savior in all their distress. It was no messenger or angel but his presence that saved them**; in his love and pity it was he who redeemed them; he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old."
verse="Isaiah 63:8-9"
%}

---

In the next passage it seems very clear that the angel of YHWH also bears His name:

{% include verse.html
text="Then he showed me the high priest Joshua standing before the **angel of YHWH** and the accuser standing at his right hand to accuse him. And <strong>YHWH said</strong> to the accuser, “<strong>YHWH rebuke you, O accuser!</strong> YHWH who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is not this man a brand plucked from the fire?”"
verse="Zechariah 3:1-2"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="On that day YHWH will shield the inhabitants of Jerusalem so that the feeblest among them on that day shall be like David, and the house of David shall be **like God, like the angel of YHWH**, at their head."
verse="Zechariah 12:8"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="He blessed Joseph and said, “The God before whom my ancestors Abraham and Isaac walked, **the God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day, the angel who has redeemed me from all harm,** bless the boys, and in them let my name be perpetuated and the name of my ancestors Abraham and Isaac, and let them grow into a multitude on the earth.”"
verse="Genesis 48:15-16"
%}

The word for God here is "Elohim", and the word for angel is "malak".

## The Right Hand of YHWH?

{% include verse.html
text="Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel, whom I called: I am he; **I am the first, and I am the last**. My hand laid the foundation of the earth, and <strong>my right hand spread out the heavens</strong>; when I summon them, they stand at attention."

text="**YHWH has bared his holy arm** before the eyes of all the nations, and all the ends of the earth shall <strong>see the salvation [Hebrew: Yeshua] of our God</strong>."

%}

{% include verse.html
text="Who has believed what we have heard? **And to whom has the arm of YHWH been revealed?** For he grew up before him like a young plant and like a root out of dry ground; he had no form or majesty that we should look at him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him."
verse="Isaiah 53:1-2"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="I will bring near my deliverance swiftly; my salvation has gone out, and **my arms will rule the peoples**; the coastlands wait for me, and <strong>for my arm they hope</strong>. Lift up your eyes to the heavens and look at the earth beneath, for the heavens will vanish like smoke, the earth will wear out like a garment, and those who live on it will die like gnats, but <strong>my salvation [Hebrew: Yeshua] will be forever</strong>, and my deliverance will never be ended."
verse="Isaiah 51:5-6"
%}

## Yeshua is Worshipped

{% include verse.html
text="Once when Joshua was by Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing before him with a drawn sword in his hand. Joshua went to him and said to him, “Are you one of us or one of our adversaries?” He replied, “Neither, but as commander of the army of YHWH I have now come.” **And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshiped**, and he said to him, “What do you command your servant, my lord?”"
verse="Joshua 5:13-14"
%}

We know this isn't an angel because it is forbidden to worship angels ({% include inline-verse.html verse="Revelation 22:8-9" text-after="," %} {% include inline-verse.html verse="Matthew 4:9-10" text-after=")." %}

On further investigation, "worship" is probably the wrong translation in this passage from Joshua. We see the same word "shâchâh" used in {% include inline-verse.html verse="Genesis 19:1" text-after="," %} where Lot "bows" to two angels. I have kept this section for the sake of completeness.

{% include verse.html
