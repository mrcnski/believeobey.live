Welcome to *Believe, Obey, Live*. This is a site where I gather and share my
personal Bible studies. My goal is to present Scripture with a minimum of
"private interpretation", letting God's word speak for itself.

The name of the site is based on my understanding that if you believe and obey,
and endure to the end, you will live:

    text="For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who
believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life. [...] Whoever believes
in the Son has eternal life; **whoever disobeys the Son will not see life** but must
endure Godâ€™s wrath."
    verse="John 3:16,36"
