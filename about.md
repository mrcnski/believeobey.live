Welcome to *Believe, Obey, Live*. This is a site where I gather and share my
personal Bible studies. My goal is to present Scripture with a minimum of
"private interpretation", letting God's word speak for itself.

The name of the site is based on my understanding that if you believe and obey,
and endure to the end, you will live:

{% include verse.html
text="But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become God’s children, to **those who believe in his name** ..."
verse="John 1:12"

{% include verse.html

The word "listen" here is <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h8085/ylt/wlc/0-1/"><i>shawmah</i></a>, which means hear/obey.

{% include verse.html
text="It shall happen, that whoever will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him."

text="Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, **teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you**."
verse="Matthew 28:19-20"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="For God so loved the world, that he gave his only born Son, that **whoever believes in him should not perish**, but have eternal life. [...] One who believes in the Son has eternal life, but **one who disobeys the Son won’t see life**, but the wrath of God remains on him."
verse="John 3:16,36"
