Welcome to *Believe, Obey, Live*. This is a site where I gather and share my
personal Bible studies. My goal is to present Scripture with a minimum of
"private interpretation", letting God's word speak for itself.

## About the Name

The name of the site is based on my understanding that if you believe and obey,
and endure to the end, you will live:
