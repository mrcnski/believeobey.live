# Welcome

Welcome to *Believe, Obey, Live*. This is a site where I gather and share my
personal Bible studies. My goal is to present Scripture with a minimum of
"private interpretation", letting God's word speak for itself.

The name of the site is based on my understanding that if you believe and obey,
and endure to the end, you will live:

{% include verse.html
text="If you love me, you will keep my commandments."
verse="John 14:15"
%}

{% include verse.html
text="Then the dragon was angry with the woman and went off to wage war on the rest of her children, those who keep the commandments of God and hold the testimony of Jesus."

{% include verse.html
text="Here is a call for the endurance of the **saints**, those who keep the commandments of God and hold fast to the faith of Jesus."

{% include verse.html
   text=".... we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the **obedience of faith** among all the Gentiles for the sake of His name ..."

{% include verse.html
text="Anyone who does not heed the words that The Prophet shall speak in my name, I myself will hold accountable."

{% include verse.html
    text="For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who
believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life. [...] Whoever believes
in the Son has eternal life; **whoever disobeys the Son will not see life** but must
endure Godâ€™s wrath."
    verse="John 3:16,36"
%}

... etc.
